# Fast Copy Assignment Grading Project

## Overview
This project contains PDF submissions for a "fast_copy" programming assignment and their grading results.

## Project Structure
- `grading_results.md` - Complete grading report with scores and detailed feedback for all submissions
- `Problem Statement - fast_copy - Google Docs (1).pdf` - The original assignment problem statement
- `*.pdf` (other files) - Individual student submissions

## Assignment Summary
The assignment required implementing a performance-critical `fast_copy(source, count)` function that:
1. Uses fixed-width transfer groups of exactly 8 elements
2. Handles partial groups using explicit control flow (not loops)
3. Minimizes control checks
4. Uses element-by-element assignment only

## Grading Results
See `grading_results.md` for complete grading breakdown including:
- Individual scores for each submission
- Detailed feedback
- Summary statistics
- Grade distribution

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11
- pypdf (for PDF text extraction)
